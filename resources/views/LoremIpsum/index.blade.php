  <h1>Developer's Best Friend</h1>

  <p>Hello there! Are you in need of placeholder data to test out the kinks of your application(or maybe you're just here to have fun!).
     Anyhow, you came to the right place. Below are some tools (developed by yours truly). Check it out. I highly recommend doing so.
      Trust me, it's truly mind blowing! :)

  <h2>Lorem Ipsum Generator</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="" alt="">Click me</a>
    to generate lorem ipsum text. It's simple. All you have to do is provide the number of paragraphs.
    And, I will do the heavy lifting to generate the desired number of paragraphs with lorem ipsum text.
  </p>

  <h2>Random User Generator</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="" alt="">Click me</a> to generate random users. Again, all you have to do is provide the number of users desired and any
     pertinent information(like Date of Birth, Brief description, etc).You sit back and relax!!
     And, I will go and do the work for you.
